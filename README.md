# cMDT

cMDT is a Powershell Module to help automize MDT server deployment and configuration with Desired State Configuration.

  - Download and install prerequisites
  - Installation and configuration of MDT components
  - Creation of Boot Images
  - Lifecycle management for all components

You can use this module with a pull server, an SMB share or a local file repository.

### Version
1.0.0.7

### Build Status
[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/sbeyuemipborrikl?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ulfvins/cmdt)

### Prerequisites

cMDT uses a number of components and open resource kit modules. The following are prerequisites for the module and need to be installed to the inteded deployment server:
* [.Net3.5] - .Net Framweworks 3.5
* [WMF5] - Windows Management Framework 5.0 or higher
* [xSmbShare] - DSC Module available from Powershell Gallery
* [cNtfsAccessControl] - DSC Module available from Powershell Gallery

The following prerequisites can automatically be downloaded with the cMDT Module:
* [MicrosoftDeploymentToolkit2013_x64] - Microsoft Deployment Toolkit (6.3.8443.1000)
* [adksetup] - Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit (build 8443)

Note: The MDT and ADK versions must compatible for the DSC modules to work.

And of course the cMDT Module itself which is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub or from the Powershell Gallery.

### Installation

To install the cMDT Module from the Powershell Gallery:

1. Make sure you have installed all prerequisites.
2. Install the cMDT module (Install-Module cMDT)
3. Create a source directory (Example: C:\Sources) If you use another driveletter and patch you need to edit the configuration file:
(C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\cMDT\1.0.0.6\Examples\Deploy_MDT_Server_ConfigurationData.psd1)
4. Copy install.wim file from a Windows 10 media to C:\Sources and rename the file to install_1.0.0.0.wim
5. Copy the Zip-files PEExtraFiles_1.0.0.0.zip and Scripts_1.0.0.0.zip from (C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\cMDT\1.0.0.6\Sources) to the C:\Sources directory. 
5. Run Powershell ISE as Administrator and open the file: C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\cMDT\1.0.0.6\Examples\Deploy_MDT_Server.ps1
7. Press F5 to run the script. It will take approximately 30 min (Depending on internet capacity and virtualization hardware). The server will reboot ones during this process.

### Known bugs
There is a known bug in the PSDesiredStateConfiguration User Resource that occur when performing a test method for an existing account. This will prevent you from for example changing the password of the MDTLocalAccount from the example contract. You will be able to create this account initially but all verification tests against this account will fail afterwards. This bug has been reported to Microsoft.
